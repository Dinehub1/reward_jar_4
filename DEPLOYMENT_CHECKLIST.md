## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Existing variables (should already be set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# New monitoring variables (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ERROR_TRACKING_ENABLED=true
```

### Database Preparation
- [ ] Verify user roles (1=admin, 2=business, 3=customer)
- [ ] Ensure RLS policies allow proper dashboard access
- [ ] Test industry benchmarking data queries
- [ ] Confirm customer_cards table unified schema

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Deploy to staging first
vercel --env staging

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Feature Rollout Strategy
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Enable for admin users only (internal testing)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Enable for 10% of business users (A/B test)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Full rollout to all users

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Enable API response time monitoring
- [ ] Set up error rate alerts (>1% error rate)
- [ ] Monitor mobile vs desktop usage patterns
- [ ] Track user engagement with new features

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Immediate Checks (0-4 hours)
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Mobile navigation working on multiple devices
- [ ] Error handling triggers appropriately
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Short-term Monitoring (1-7 days)
- [ ] API response times staying < 500ms
- [ ] Error rates below 1%
- [ ] Mobile user satisfaction feedback
- [ ] Support ticket volume (should decrease)
- [ ] Feature adoption metrics

### Performance Metrics to Track
```typescript
// Expected improvements
const metrics = {
  apiResponseTime: 'Before: 2-3s â†’ After: <500ms',
  mobilePageLoad: 'Before: 4-5s â†’ After: <2s', 
  errorRate: 'Before: 3-5% â†’ After: <1%',
  supportTickets: 'Expected: 40% reduction',
  mobileUserSatisfaction: 'Target: >4.5/5'
}
```

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise:
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Partial Rollback**: Disable new API endpoint, use legacy endpoints
3. **Feature Toggle**: Disable mobile navigation, keep desktop layout

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel --rollback

# Or specific deployment
vercel --rollback [deployment-url]
```
