    if (customerCard.stamp_card_id) return 'stamp_card';
    if (customerCard.membership_card_id) return 'membership_card';
    return 'invalid';
  },
  
  // ‚úÖ Next.js 15+ - Route params handling
  extractCardId: async (params: Promise<{ id: string }>) => {
    const { id } = await params; // Server component
    return id;
  },
  
  extractCardIdClient: (params: Promise<{ id: string }>) => {
    const { id } = use(params); // Client component with React.use()
    return id;
  },
  progressCalculation: {
    stamp_card: "(current_stamps / stamp_cards.total_stamps) * 100",
    membership_card: "(sessions_used / membership_cards.total_sessions) * 100"
  },
  themeSelection: {
    stamp_card: "Green theme (#10b981)",
