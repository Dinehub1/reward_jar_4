## üìã Overview

RewardJar 4.0 provides comprehensive user journeys for three distinct user roles, each with tailored experiences and capabilities:

- **Customers (role_id: 3)**: QR-based entry, wallet integration, loyalty tracking
- **Businesses (role_id: 2)**: Dashboard management, analytics, revenue tracking

## üë§ Customer Journey

### Authentication & Signup

#### Email-Based Signup/Login (Supabase OTP)
| Stage | Action | Route | Requirements | Response |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Signup** | Customer registration | `POST /api/customer/signup` | Email, Password | OTP sent via Supabase |
| **OTP Verification** | Email verification | `POST /api/customer/verify-otp` | Email, OTP code | JWT token, role_id: 3 |
| **Login** | Existing customer login | `POST /api/customer/login` | Email, Password | Session token |
| **Guest Access** | QR scan without login | `/join/[cardId]` | None | Card preview, login prompt |

**Authentication Flow**:
```typescript
// Customer signup process
const signupFlow = {
  step1: "Email/password submission ‚Üí Supabase OTP generation",
  step2: "OTP verification ‚Üí User creation with role_id: 3",
  step3: "Customer profile creation ‚Üí Dashboard redirect",
  guestMode: "QR access allowed, stamps/rewards require authentication"
};
```

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid email format ‚Üí "Please enter a valid email address"
- Incorrect OTP ‚Üí "Invalid verification code, please try again"
- Duplicate account ‚Üí "Account already exists, please login"
- Session expired ‚Üí "Please login again to continue"

### QR Code Scanning & Card Discovery

#### Native Camera Integration
| Device Type | QR Scan Result | Wallet Option | Route |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **iPhone** | Card detected | Apple Wallet prompt | `/join/[cardId]?wallet=apple` |
| **Android** | Card detected | Google Wallet prompt | `/join/[cardId]?wallet=google` |
| **PWA/Web** | Card detected | Both wallet options | `/join/[cardId]?wallet=pwa` |
| **Guest User** | Card preview | Login required for stamps | `/join/[cardId]?guest=true` |

**QR Code Flow**:
