#### Test Scenario 1: Admin-Created Stamp Cards
```bash
# Test stamp card created by admin for Business A
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/test/wallet-preview?customerCardId=admin-stamp-card-uuid&businessId=business-a-uuid" | grep "stamp"

# Expected: Green theme, stamp progress, business A branding
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Admin-Created Membership Cards
```bash
# Test membership card created by admin for Business B
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/test/wallet-preview?customerCardId=admin-membership-card-uuid&businessId=business-b-uuid" | grep "membership"

# Expected: Indigo theme, session progress, business B branding
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Multi-Business Card Testing
```bash
# Test cards from different businesses created by same admin
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/test/wallet-preview?testMode=multi-business" 

# Expected: Dropdown to select from multiple businesses with admin-created cards
```

## ðŸ§ª Enhanced Testing Interface

### Multi-Business Simulation âœ… ACTIVE

The test interface now includes:

1. **Business Selector**: Dropdown to choose from businesses with admin-created cards
2. **Card Type Tabs**: Separate tabs for stamp cards and membership cards per business
3. **Admin Context**: Shows which admin created each card
4. **Cross-Business Testing**: Test wallet generation across different business contexts

### Test Data Generation

```bash
# Generate test data for admin card testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dev-seed/admin-cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businesses": 3,
    "stampCardsPerBusiness": 2,
    "membershipCardsPerBusiness": 1,
    "customersPerCard": 5
  }'

# Expected: Creates test ecosystem with admin-created cards across multiple businesses
```

### Validation Checks

The test interface now validates:
- âœ… Cards are created by admin users (role_id = 1)
- âœ… Cards are properly assigned to businesses
- âœ… Business owners can manage assigned cards
- âœ… Customers can join cards from any business
- âœ… Wallet generation works across all business contexts
