## 🔧 Enhanced Debug Checklist

### 1. Google Wallet RS256 Error Resolution ✅ FIXED
**Previous Error**: `"secretOrPrivateKey must be an asymmetric key when using RS256"`
**Root Cause**: Malformed private key with escaped newlines
**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// Enhanced private key validation and formatting
let privateKey = process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY

// Convert escaped newlines to actual newlines
if (privateKey.includes('\\n')) {
  privateKey = privateKey.replace(/\\n/g, '\n')
}

// Ensure proper PEM format
if (!privateKey.includes('-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----')) {
  privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n${privateKey}\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
}

// Validate structure before JWT signing
const keyLines = privateKey.split('\n')
const hasProperStructure = keyLines.length >= 3 && 
                           keyLines.some(line => line.trim() === '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----') && 
                           keyLines.some(line => line.trim() === '-----END PRIVATE KEY-----')
```

**Verification**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/google/[CARD_ID]?debug=true" | jq '.environment.privateKey'
# Expected: true
```

### 2. PWA Wallet Card Type Misidentification ✅ FIXED
**Previous Issue**: PWA showed reward/stamp data for membership cards
**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// Enhanced card type detection and rendering
const isMembership = customerCard.membership_type === 'gym' || customerCard.membership_type === 'membership'
const cardTitle = isMembership ? 'Membership Card' : 'Digital Loyalty Card'
const themeColor = isMembership ? '#6366f1' : '#10b981'

// Conditional content rendering
const primaryText = isMembership ? 
  `${sessionsUsed} / ${totalSessions} Sessions Used` :
  `${currentStamps} / ${totalStamps} Stamps`
```

**Verification**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/pwa/[MEMBERSHIP_CARD_ID]" | grep -o "Membership Card"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/pwa/[LOYALTY_CARD_ID]" | grep -o "Digital Loyalty Card"
```

### 3. Loyalty Cards Visibility ✅ FIXED
**Previous Issue**: Test interface didn't properly display loyalty cards
**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced tab switching between loyalty and membership cards
- Improved data loading with error handling
- Added card count badges and empty state handling
- Fixed data structure processing for both card types

**Verification**:
```bash
# Access enhanced test interface
open http://localhost:3000/test/wallet-preview
# Expected: Two tabs with card counts, proper data loading
```

### Database Schema Updates ✅ LOYALTY HIERARCHY
```sql
-- Updated customer_cards schema for loyalty card hierarchy
-- Support both stamp and membership subtypes
/*
-- Update membership_type from 'gym' to 'membership' for hierarchy consistency
UPDATE customer_cards 
SET membership_type = 'membership' 
WHERE membership_type = 'gym';

-- Ensure both subtypes are supported
-- 'loyalty' = stamp cards (current_stamps, total_stamps)
-- 'membership' = membership cards (sessions_used, total_sessions, cost, expiry_date)

-- Update card_customizations to support both subtypes
UPDATE card_customizations 
SET card_type = 'membership' 
WHERE card_type = 'gym';

-- Verify schema supports both subtypes
SELECT membership_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM customer_cards 
GROUP BY membership_type;
-- Expected: 'loyalty' and 'membership' counts
*/
