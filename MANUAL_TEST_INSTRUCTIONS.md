## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Join Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look for "Auth state changed" logs
3. Verify the URL has `?autoJoin=true` parameter
4. Try manually clicking "Join Loyalty Program" button

### If Cards Don't Show in Dashboard:
1. Check if customer profile was created properly
2. Verify the join API was called successfully
3. Check database for `customer_cards` entry
4. Refresh the dashboard page

### If Wallet Preview is Empty:
1. Ensure cards are properly joined
2. Check wallet health endpoint
3. Verify customer has joined cards in database

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria
- âœ… Customer can scan QR and reach join page
- âœ… Customer can sign up from join page
- âœ… Auto-join works after authentication
- âœ… Card appears in customer dashboard
- âœ… Card shows in wallet preview
- âœ… All wallet types (Apple, Google, PWA) are available
- âœ… No crashes or undefined errors

## ðŸ“Š Database Verification
After successful join, check these tables:
- `users` - Should have customer entry with `role_id = 3`
- `customers` - Should have customer profile
- `customer_cards` - Should have join entry linking customer to card
- `stamp_cards` - Should have the business card

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues
1. **"User already registered"** - Use different email or login instead
2. **"Card not found"** - Verify card ID is correct and card is active
3. **"Authentication required"** - Check if session is properly maintained
4. **Empty dashboard** - Check if auto-join actually completed

**Note**: This flow should work end-to-end without any manual intervention once the customer clicks "Create Account & Join".
