# Apple Wallet Certificate Mismatch Fix

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: The Apple Wallet PKPass generation is failing because the certificate (`pass.pem`) and private key (`pass.key`) don't match.

**Evidence**:
- Certificate MD5: `f6a0a23ead30938e7c621d2ea01a0736`
- Private Key MD5: `8403330447a48aac1d4169bd43c17433`
- **These hashes should be identical for a matching pair**

**Impact**: 
- PKCS#7 signature generation fails
- PKPass files contain JSON error messages instead of valid signatures
- iOS shows "Sorry, your Pass cannot be installed to Passbook at this time"

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Certificate Details
```bash
# Current certificate subject:
Subject: UID=pass.com.rewardjar.rewards, CN=Pass Type ID: pass.com.rewardjar.rewards, OU=39CDB598RF, O=Jaydeep Kukreja, C=IN

# Certificate validity:
notBefore=Jun  6 07:27:58 2025 GMT
notAfter=Jul  6 07:27:57 2026 GMT
```

### Key Mismatch
The certificate was generated with a different private key than the one currently in use. This happens when:
1. Multiple certificate requests are made with different keys
2. The wrong certificate is downloaded from Apple Developer portal
3. Certificate and key files get mixed up during deployment

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Generate New Certificate (Recommended)
1. Use the existing `pass.key` to generate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
2. Upload the CSR to Apple Developer portal
3. Download the new certificate that matches the key

### Option 2: Generate New Key-Certificate Pair
1. Generate a new private key
2. Create CSR with the new key
3. Get certificate from Apple Developer portal
4. Update both key and certificate in environment variables

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Generate New CSR with Existing Key
```bash
cd "licence and cetifi"
openssl req -new -key pass.key -out pass_new.csr -subj "/UID=pass.com.rewardjar.rewards/CN=Pass Type ID: pass.com.rewardjar.rewards/OU=39CDB598RF/O=Jaydeep Kukreja/C=IN"
```

### Step 2: Submit CSR to Apple Developer Portal
1. Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
2. Click "+" to create new certificate
3. Select "Pass Type ID Certificate"
4. Upload the `pass_new.csr` file
5. Download the new certificate as `pass_new.cer`

### Step 3: Convert and Update Certificate
```bash
# Convert to PEM format
openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in pass_new.cer -out pass_new.pem

# Verify it matches the key
openssl x509 -in pass_new.pem -noout -modulus | openssl md5
openssl rsa -in pass.key -noout -modulus | openssl md5
# These should now match!

# Convert to base64 for environment variable
base64 -i pass_new.pem -o pass_new_base64.txt
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables
Replace the `APPLE_CERT_BASE64` value in `.env.local` with the content from `pass_new_base64.txt`.

## 🧪 Testing Solution

### Temporary Fix for Testing
I've created a temporary self-signed certificate that matches the existing key:

```bash
# Generated temporary certificate with matching key
openssl x509 -req -in pass_new.csr -signkey pass.key -out pass_temp.pem -days 365

# Verification shows they match:
# Certificate MD5: 8403330447a48aac1d4169bd43c17433
# Private Key MD5: 8403330447a48aac1d4169bd43c17433 ✅
```

### Test Results
```bash
# PKCS#7 signature generation - SUCCESS
openssl smime -sign -signer pass_temp.pem -inkey pass.key -certfile wwdr.pem -in test-manifest.json -out test-signature -outform DER -binary -noattr

# Signature verification - SUCCESS
openssl smime -verify -in test-signature -inform DER -content test-manifest.json -CAfile wwdr.pem -noverify
# Output: Verification successful ✅
```

## 📋 Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Generate new CSR with existing private key
- [ ] Submit CSR to Apple Developer Portal
- [ ] Download new certificate
- [ ] Verify certificate matches private key (MD5 hashes identical)
- [ ] Convert certificate to base64 format
- [ ] Test signature generation locally

### Environment Update
- [ ] Update `APPLE_CERT_BASE64` in production environment
- [ ] Restart application to load new certificate
- [ ] Test PKPass generation endpoint
- [ ] Verify signature validation passes

### Verification
- [ ] Generate test PKPass file
- [ ] Verify PKPass contains valid PKCS#7 signature (not JSON error)
- [ ] Test PKPass installation on iOS device
- [ ] Confirm "Add to Wallet" functionality works

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Certificate Validity
- Current certificate expires: **July 6, 2026**
- WWDR certificate expires: **December 10, 2030**
- Set calendar reminders for renewal

### Key Management
- Keep private key secure and backed up
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployment
- Consider using key management services for production

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
PKPass Structure:
├── pass.json ✅
├── manifest.json ✅
├── signature ❌ (JSON error message)
├── icons... ✅

Status: "Sorry, your Pass cannot be installed to Passbook at this time"
```

### After Fix
```
PKPass Structure:
├── pass.json ✅
├── manifest.json ✅
